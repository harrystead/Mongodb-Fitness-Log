### Mongodb Fitness Log

Live Site: https://salty-journey-10803.herokuapp.com/

This project is a workout tracker which uses a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handles routes with Express.

### User Story 

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance travelled.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

* Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
* Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
* View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
* View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
